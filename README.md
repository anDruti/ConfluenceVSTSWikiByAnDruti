# ConfluenceVSTSWikiByAnDruti
Tools written for migration the Confluence articles to VSTS Wiki

The Repository will contain:
1. Bat file written by me for running the pandoc over HTML exported files from Confluence to translate it to .md files.
Pandoc is available to download, I used .msi dedicated for Windows mainly.
2. Simple Java Tool for going through .md files and getting rid off trash/garbage, translate it to more convinient form for VSTS wiki.
3. Presentation to visualize the problems, those that were solved with this PoC ( by Java Tool ) and those that were recognized but not solved yet.
